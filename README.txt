sharpGIFs creates animated gif's from a collection of still images.

The project started as a result of getting a GoPro camera that had the 
capabiliy of taking bursts of images for example 30 images in 3 seconds.
The author wanted a simple, free, windows desktop application that could 
stitch the images togheter to an animated gif. 

sharpGif's is written in C#. The user can set the size of the finished 
gif (the program keeps apect ratio) and the animation speed/frame delay.
